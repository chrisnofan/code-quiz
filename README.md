## Discription

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. 

The application can:

- Display a button used to start the quiz at the first view

- Present a series of questions when clicking the "Start Quiz" button 
    
- Start a countdown timer once the quiz begins

- Subtract additional time (i.e., 10 seconds) from the timer if a question is answered incorrectly

- End the game when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero

## Usage 

When opening the app in the browser, the user will be presented with a start screen with quiz rules. Once the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, a countdown timer starts and the quiz taker is presented with a multiple-choice question. When clicking one choice, the quiz taker will hear a sound indicating if the answer is correct or incorrect. Incorrect answers will penalize the quiz time by subtracting time (i.e., 10 seconds) from the clock. After answering a question, another question will be displayed. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, the game is over. Then the quiz taker can save their initials and score by clicking the "Submit" button. All the saved high scores can be  viewed on another page. When clicking "Go Back", the quiz taker can start another game. When clicking "Clear Highscores", all the saved scores will be removed. The quiz taker can also view the stored highscores by pressing "View Highscores".
